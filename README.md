# 📡 Telecom Churn Prediction Challenge - Part 2

Welcome to the **Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Challenge - Part 2**!  
In this project, I aim to **predict which customers are likely to cancel their services** and provide actionable insights to help the company retain them.

---

🎯 **Mission**  
The company wants to **proactively prevent customer churn**, and your goal is to build a **robust machine learning pipeline** that identifies high-risk customers and highlights the key factors driving cancellations.

---

🧠 **Challenge Objectives**  
1. **Data Preparation:** Clean, encode, and normalize the dataset for modeling.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Analyze correlations, visualize patterns, and select important features.  
3. **Modeling:** Train and compare **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers.  
4. **Evaluation:** Assess models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**, and **Confusion Matrix**.  
5. **Interpretation:** Understand feature importance and which factors most influence churn.  
6. **Strategic Recommendations:** Suggest actionable retention strategies based on model insights.

📊 **Key Highlights from the Analysis**  
- Customers with **Month-to-Month contracts** are more likely to churn.  
- **Newer customers** (shorter tenure) have higher cancellation risk.  
- Lack of additional services such as **Online Security, Device Protection, or Tech Support** increases churn probability.  
- Payment method and paperless billing behavior can influence retention.  

> Using **SMOTE** to balance the dataset improved the models’ ability to detect minority class (churned customers).  
> **Random Forest** showed the best performance overall, especially in detecting high-risk churners.
